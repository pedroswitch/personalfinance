# Personal Finance

A small web application to manage personal finances. 
The purpose is to practice and consolidate what I learn in SWitCH Dev.
The objective is to practice:
1. DDD architecture;
2. Database operations (with repositories);
3. Business logic (in services);
4. API design (it is a web application!);
5. Unit and integration testing;
6. Front-end development (with REACT).
